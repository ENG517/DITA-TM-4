Write an analysis (~500 words) in a single-spaced memo format. Save it in the root of your project as reflection.md, wherein you write about the following:

- Create a section for each user scenario of which your model responds,
- Provide an outline of the DITA maps that respond to the scenario, and
- Reference the maps and their outputs as a means to explain how the map and output responds to that scenario.
