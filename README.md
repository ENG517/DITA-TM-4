### User Scenario 1: Beginner User

A first-time typewriter user, Genesis, has just purchased her very first typewriter. She wants to start using her typewriter for creative writing, but she has never set up a typewriter for use before, and doesn’t know where to begin. She needs to learn how to load paper into her machine, and how to format the paper before she begins typing.

### User Scenario 2: Intermediate User

An intermediate typewriter user, Park, is writing their debut novel on their vintage typewriter. They have written an extensive amount of text and have noticed that their typewriter is running low on ink, has an overall low performance, and is getting a bit dirty. They would like to continue using their typewriter, but they are relatively inexperienced in typewriter maintenance, and need to know how to clean the typewriter and perform some minor repairs.
