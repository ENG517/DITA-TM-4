## Macro-Level Revisions

Our most significant macro-level revision was the restructure of our dita maps. Rather than formatting our maps by topic type, grouping concepts, tasks, and references together separately, we reordered the topics so that each task was supported by the necessary concept and reference topics. This resulted in a better work flow throughout the topic models, eliminating the possibility of certain topics getting buried. The comparisons of our original maps and our new maps can be seen in Figures 1-2 for our beginner use, Genesis, Figures 3-4 for our intermediate user, Park, and Figures 5-6 for our advanced user, Hunter.

## Plain Language Editing

### Revision Focus 1:

   To revise for plain language, we broke up our topics evenly and each implemented multiple editing techniques discussed in class lectures. We first implemented multiple changes to our -ing verb usage, including improving their punctuation and reducing them overall. Most of our -ing verbs were already punctuated appropriately, but some instances of rephrasing to reduce word count and improve readability allowed for the implementation of appropriate punctuation. These instances can be seen in our reference topic on typewriter case types (r_typewriter_case_types.dita), as seen in Figures 7-8, and our concept topic on lubrication guidelines (c_lubrication_guidelines.dita), as seen in Figures 9-10.

  >*Figure 10: Lubrication Guidelines (After)*

### Revision Focus 2:

   We noticed some syntactic ambiguities while we were implementing the changes noted above, particularly with regard to a lack of relative pronouns. Although these instances were fewer than edits made to our -ing verbs and word reduction, they were a noticeable improvement for clarity in the writing. An example of this can be seen in Figures 11-12, from the task topic on removing typewriter panels (t_remove_panels.dita).

  >*Figure 12: Removing Panels (After)*

### Revision Focus 3:

   Our most significant changes were made to reduce word count and lengthy, run-on sentences. By rephrasing verbose sentences and paragraphs, we were able to make the concept and task topics more concise for the users. Examples of this strategy can be seen in Figures 13-14, from our concept topic on diagnosing platen conditions (c_diagnosis_platen_conditions.dita), and Figures 15-16, from our task topic on setting visible margins (t_set_visiblemargins.dita).

  >*Figure 16: Setting Margins (After)*

## Revision Focus 4:

   Simultaneously, we worked to reduce the amount of -ing verbs used throughout the topics as a way to increase manageability of reading within our text. We found a few instances where eliminating the -ing verbs, and using more direct, active verbs, helped us break our text down further. Examples of this can be found in Figures 17-18, from our task topic on reattaching the drawband (t_reattach_drawband.dita), and Figures 19-20, from our concept topic on issues with loading paper (c_loading-paper-issues.dita)

  >*Figure 20: Loading Paper Issues (After)*

## Revision Focus 5:

   Lastly, we tried to implement edits that reduced ambiguous antecedents. We found a few instances where we lacked specificity in our steps, context, and definitions that could potentially introduce confusion or disorientation when users are reading the topics. We removed these issues by specifying the object/noun being discussed whenever possible. An example of this can be seen in Figures 21-22, from our reference topic on the Holiday Case terminology (r_typewriter_holiday_case_terms.dita)

  >*Figure 22: Holiday Case Terminology (After)*


## Micro-Level Revisions

   Next, we implemented a few instances of micro-level redesigns to help support clarity and a smoother flow in our topics. We first updated indentation issues throughout the topics, an example of which can be seen in the comparison of Figures 23 and 24. We then made sure our headings were consistent throughout each topic type, resulting in some minor changes of section titles, such as the example shown in Figures 25-26 from the concept topic “c_materials_required_mainspring_drawband_repair.dita.”

![Mainspring Repair Materials (After)](/assets/images/Figure%2026_Heading%20Consistency%20(after).png)

  >*Figure 26: Mainspring Repair Materials (After)*

   We also changed some of our information from <info> to <note> styles, including note types to alert the user when information was pertinent to the task at hand. An example of this change can be seen in Figures 27-28, from the task topic file “t_repair_mainspring.dita.” We also implemented some structural changes to our information design, choosing to use tables rather than list items to allow for a clear demonstration of categorized information. This can be seen in Figures 29-30, which depict a change of information design from a list to a table in the concept topic file “c_diagnosis_platen_conditions.dita.” Lastly, we focused on some minor language changes to include more active verbs, moving away from passive language in some areas. This allowed for more direct and clear steps throughout our tasks. An example of this can be seen in Figures 31-32, from the task topic file “t_replace_mainspring.dita.”
