## Clean The Platen Roller

The first step in repairing a platen roller is to clean it. This will allow you to see any tears, cracks, or severe indents on the roller that may indicate further repairs are needed.

 1. Activate the paper release lever so that the feed rollers and paper bail rollers are not touching the platen roller.
 2. Apply a light layer of your lacquer thinner to a lint free cloth.
 3. Rub the platen with the cloth along the cylinder, cleaning the entire surface of the roller.
 4. Once the thinner has dried down, clean it once more with a clean lint free cloth and fresh lacquer thinner. 
 5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until little to no residue is coming off on the cloth.
 6. If you notice your feed rollers or paper bail rollers are a bit dirty, clean them with a new cloth and fresh lacquer thinner.

## Inspect The Platen Roller

After cleaning the Platen Roller, inspect its surface to determine your next steps.

 - If the surface has hardened or has micro cracks throughout the roller, the platen roller needs to be refinished.
 - If the surface has severe indentation markings from type slugs, or has extensive cracking throughout the roller, it needs to be replaced.
 - If the surface has minimal indents or cracks, and feels glazed over or mildly hardened, it needs to be sanded.
 - If the surface has no cracks, indents, or hardened spots, and still feels rubbery to the touch, no additional steps are needed.

## Remove The Platen Roller

 1. Raise the paper support and paper bail so that they are not resting on the platen.
 2. Activate the carriage centering lever to center the carriage.
 3. Pull the platen detent arm outwards.
 4. Press the platen release lever.
 5. Lift the platen roller up and to the right to remove from the typewriter.

## Sand The Platen Roller

After removing the platen roller from the typewriter, follow the steps below to sand the roller.

 1. Wrap your sandpaper around the platen roller.
 2. Turn the platen by hand to evenly sand the entire surface.
 3. Gently work the sandpaper up and down the length of the platen roller to remove the hardened top layer of rubber.
 4. Remove sand debris from the roller using a damp cloth.
 5. Set the roller in front of a fan to quickly dry the surface.

If no additional repairs are needed, skip to “Insert The Platen Roller.”
