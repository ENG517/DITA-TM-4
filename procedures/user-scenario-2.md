# User Scenario 2 - Intermediate User

**Scenario**: An intermediate typewriter user, Park, is writing their debut novel on their vintage typewriter. They have written an extensive amount of text and have noticed that their typewriter is running low on ink, has an overall low performance, and is getting a bit dirty. They would like to continue using their typewriter, but they are relatively inexperienced in typewriter maintenance, and need to know how to clean the typewriter and perform some minor repairs.
