# How To Repair and Replace Typewriter Springs on a Portable Smith Corona Manual Typewriter

Repairs to the drawband and/or Mainspring are typically required when the carriage movement begins to stall, stops altogether, or loses tension. If your typewriter is having any of these issues, read on to remedy those problems.

## Materials

## Inspect The Machine

 1. Try to move the carriage to the right side of the machine.
 2. Visually inspect the drawband for a loosened connection.
 3. Try to manually rotate the spring barrel.

## Identify The Problem

 - If the carriage moves freely and the drawband has come loose from the spring barrel, it needs to be reattached. Read the section below, titled “Reattach the drawband.”
 - If the carriage moves freely and the drawband is in good condition, but the spring barrel rotates without tension, the spring is broken and needs to be replaced. Read the section below, titled “Replace the Mainspring.”
 - If the carriage does not move freely, and the spring barrel is not rotating easily, the spring needs to be cleaned, flushed, and lubricated. Read the section below, titled “Repair the Mainspring.”
 - If none of the above conditions match your concerns, the issue is likely not dependent on the spring, and further disassembly is required to diagnose the problem. Consider taking the machine to a professional typewriter restoration servicer.

## Remove The Drawband

If any repairs or replacements to the drawband or mainspring are required, you must first remove the drawband from the spring barrel.

 1. Locate the point of connection where the drawband meets the spring housing.
    - The end of the spring should have a knot or metal hook-like feature that is connected to the mainspring barrel by sliding into a thin slot through a hole in the barrel. The hole is large enough to fit the knot or hook for removal, but the slot is thin enough to contain the drawband knot/hook.
 2. Grab the drawband with a pair of needle nosed pliers and gently slide it out of the thin barrel slot, guiding it all of the way out through the hole in the barrel.

## Repair The Mainspring

 1. Remove the mainspring housing from the typewriter by unscrewing the two barrel attachment screws.
 2. Set the housing on a rag, with the metal side of the barrel facing up.
 3. Using the pipette or dropper, apply a few drops of degreaser on and around the center screw and slot.
    - ***Warning***: Once the degreaser reaches the mainspring and loosens it, the barrel may jump or pop as the tension in the spring is released.
 4. Use the stiff-bristle brush and soft-bristle brushes as needed to clean any gummed up debris from the center screw.
 5. Spray the barrel with compressed air to further remove loosened debris.
 6. Repeat steps 4 through 6 until the spring barrel is able to rotate easily, while still maintaining some tension.
 7. Once the spring barrel is able to rotate, fully dry the barrel using a lint free cloth and compressed air.
 8. Reattach the spring barrel to the typewriter undercarriage using the two attachment screws.
 9. Reattach the drawband to the spring barrel using the steps outlined in the section below, titled “Reattach the drawband.”

## Replace The Mainspring

***Warning***: Typewriter mainsprings are wound very tightly. Wearing gloves and eye protection is essential to protect your hands and eyes from the sharp edges of the spring, as they can and often will pop out quickly during the removal process. 

 1. Remove the mainspring housing from the typewriter by unscrewing the two barrel attachment screws.
 2. Unscrew the back of the mainspring barrel using a small allen wrench.
 3. Put on gloves and eye protection.
 4. Disassemble the mainspring housing by sliding each gear layer off of the center shaft.
 5. Using a pair of needle nosed pliers, gently remove the broken spring pieces from the spring barrel. Ensure that all pieces of the spring are fully removed before continuing.
 6. Set all broken spring pieces aside, away from your work area, to avoid accidentally cutting yourself or damaging fragile components of the typewriter.
 7. Line up the end of your new mainspring with the notch inside the barrel.
 8. Wind the spring up, moving inwards toward the center of the barrel, so that the spring is coiled tightly.
 9. Reassemble the spring barrel with the rest of the housing components by sliding them together along their connecting center shafts.
 10. Complete the reassembly by tightening the hex nut with an allen wrench.
 11. Reattach the spring barrel to the typewriter undercarriage using the two attachment screws.
 12. Reattach the drawband to the spring barrel using the steps outlined in the section below, titled “Reattach the drawband.”

## Reattach The Drawband

Whether your drawband has come loose, you are replacing your drawband, or have made repairs to the mainspring, you will now need to reattach the drawband to the spring barrel. Review the following steps to complete this task.

 1. Slide the carriage all the way to the right hand side.
 2. Locate the end of the drawband, ensuring it is still knotted or has a hooked end.
 3. Rotate the mainspring barrel towards the right side of the carriage to build tension and hold it there. Three to four full rotations should suffice.
 4. Insert the drawband into the hole in the mainspring barrel.
 5. Slide the drawband into the thin barrel slot.
 6. Release the mainspring barrel slowly, keeping the drawband in line with the barrel until it is fully released.
 7. If there is slack in the drawband, the barrel did not have enough tension. Remove the drawband and try again, rotating the barrel a few more times.
