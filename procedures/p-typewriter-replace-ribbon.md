# How To Change a Typewriter Ribbon On A 1950's Smith Corona Typewriter

So, you've been writing on your typewriter for a while and your text is starting to look a bit see-through. Luckily, there's a simple fix for that! Read on to learn how to replace a typewriter ribbon and eliminate those obnoxious transparent letters.

## Materials

Not much is required to successfully change your typewriters ink ribbon. All you need is:
 1. A Typewriter
 2. A New Ink Ribbon
     > Note: 1950's Manual Smith Corona typewriters are compatible with universal ribbons.
 3. Gloves (optional)
     - Typewriter ribbons are fully saturated in ink, so handling them can get quite messy. If you prefer to remain ink-stain free, wearing nitrile, latex, or plastic gloves are recommended.
 4. Paper Towels/Cleaning Cloth (optional)
     - Although optional, having something to wipe down excess ink from the work surface and the typewriters interior can be helpful to make this simple task go smoothly!


## Preparation

Put on your gloves and lay out plastic surface protection or paper towels/cloths under and next to the typewriter to keep ink from staining surfaces and have a convenient location to sit the new and old ink ribbons while changing them. 

## Changing the Ribbon

To change your typewriter ribbon, follow these steps:
 1. Lift The Ribbon Cover
     - Gently lift the front edge of the ribbon cover until it is fully opened.

 2. Remove Existing Typewriter Ribbon
     - Slowly lift one of the ribbon spools from its metal spool holder
     - Gently pull the ribbon upwards and out of the auto-reversing bracket
     - Repeat the above two steps for the second ribbon spool
     - Locate the set of ribbon guides that are in front of the ribbon vibrator
     - Carefully unthread the existing ribbon through the small slits in the ribbon guides

     - Place one of the new ribbon spools onto the ribbon spool shaft so that the spool shaft pin fits into the designated slot on the new ribbon spool
     - Ensure that the ribbon coming off of the spool is directed toward the back of the typewriter and is not twisted
     - Carefully slide the ribbon into the auto-reverse bracket directly next to the metal spool shaft
     - Repeat for the other ribbon spool
 4. Thread the ribbon
     - Locate the set of ribbon guides that are in front of the ribbon vibrator
     - Take the ribbon between each spool and feed it through the small slots on each side of the ribbon guide, taking care to not stretch the ribbon
     - Gently rotate each ribbon spool so that the ribbon is taut, but not tightened too much

 5. Clean typewriter interior and hands
     - Carefully wipe any excess ink off of the interior of the typewriter
     - Clean your hands or remove your gloves
 6. Close the ribbon cover
     - Gently push the ribbon cover down until it is fully closed
 7. Test the new Ribbon
    - Type out a few words to ensure the ribbon ink is installed and working as desired
    - Note: The letters may look smudgy at first, this is normal and likely due to excessive ink coming off of the ribbon during the installation process. It should resolve after typing a sentence or two. 

## Additional Notes

 1. If the letters are still smudgy after a few sentences, your ribbon may be too loose and therefore struggling to make clean ink impressions. To address this issue, remove the ribbon cover and gently roll each spool so that the ribbon is more taut.

 2. If the letters continue to be smudgy as you type, your typeslugs may have gotten ink or debris on them during the installation process. Cleaning the typeslugs with rubbing alcohol or another appropriate cleaning solvent should fix this.
