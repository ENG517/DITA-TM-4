## Prepare the Work Area

 1. Select a well-ventilated space, ideally with windows and access to direct sunlight.
 2. Lay out paper towels or plastic sheeting to fully cover your work surface.
 3. Put on nitrile gloves so that mineral spirits, cleaning agents, and waxes do not touch your skin.

## Remove Typewriter From Case

Portable Smith Corona machines will typically come in a popular case known as the “Holiday Case.” It is a bit larger than normal typewriter carriers, and has the ability of being disassembled.

 1. Place the typewriter case down on a level surface, with the thinner side of the case on the bottom.
 2. Press the double safety lock to open the case.
 3. Push the machine release button back, towards the carriage return, to release the machine from the case.
 4. Lift the front side of the machine upwards, 2 to 3 inches, and pull the typewriter towards yourself, away from the hinges of the case. 


## Remove Typewriter Panels

 1. Locate the body screws, typically found on the underside of the typewriter, along the edges of the body panels.
 2. Unscrew the body screws and set off to the side, making sure you keep track of which ones go where as they each have different lengths and threads.
 3. Gently lift the panels off of the typewriter, and set aside.
 4. Locate the metal segment plate on the underside of the typewriter, directly under the segment. This plate is not screwed in, but held in place by four metal prongs that slide into the feet of the typewriter. 
 5. Gently pry the plate outward using a wide, flat-head screwdriver, so the prongs slide out of the slots in one of the feet and the plate falls out.


## Dust Typewriter

Due to the tightly-packed mechanisms of a typewriter, using compressed air from a can or portable air compressor is easiest and most effective when removing dust and debris.

 1. Optional: If your typewriter has been sitting for an extended period of time and has a visible layer of dust settled on its surface, go in with a dry lint-free cloth first and pick up as much dust as possible
 2. Spray the interior and exterior of all typewriter and case components, including the panels, case frame, segment, keys, undercarriage, and any small gears or levers with compressed air to remove any settled dirt or debris.
    - Note: Ensure the air is reaching the interior mechanisms of the typewriter. If needed, add a thin extender to your air compressor or can nozzle to get into the nooks and crevices of the machine, such as in between the key levers.

## Clean The Interior

When cleaning the interior components of a typewriter, it is best to use mineral spirits, as they are most effective in dissolving and removing stuck on grime without damaging the internal mechanisms. However, gentle degreasers and rubbing alcohol can also be used in place of mineral spirits.

***Warning***: Avoid getting mineral spirits on any rubber or soft-plastic components of the typewriter, especially the platen, feeder, and paper bail rollers, as it will degrade the rubber over time.

 1. Lift the ribbon cover into an open position.
 2. Re-package your cleaning solvent into a small bottle with a precision applicator or liquid dropper top.
 3. Apply your solvent to areas with visible grime and debris, focusing on areas of high movement, such as the type basket and segment, undercarriage, etc.
 4. Use a soft-bristled brush, such as a toothbrush, to gently scrub the areas where the mineral spirits have been applied.
 5. Take a lint-free rag, or cotton swab for hard to reach areas, and remove excess mineral spirit and loosened debris.
 6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 as needed.
 7. Apply mineral spirits to the end of the type slugs, focusing on areas with stuck-on ink.
 8. Using a stiff-bristled brush, gently scrub where the mineral spirits have been applied.
 9. Remove excess mineral spirit and loosened debris using a cotton swab
    - Note: If ink and debris is still not fully removed, use a toothpick or cleaning pick to gently scrape remaining ink and debris off of the type slugs.
 10. Set the typewriter in direct sunlight, or in front of a fan, for a few hours to a couple of days to fully dry.

## Lubricate As Needed

Portable typewriters generally do not need regular lubrication, as they are protected by their casing. However, metal-on-metal components can sometimes develop friction, which will require occasional lubrication to remedy. 

Only use light weight oils. Oils that are generally acceptable in typewriter maintenance include sewing machine oils, gun oils, and specialized typewriter lubricants.

***Warning***: Never use heavy oils, like motor oils or other automotive or household lubricants, as they are too heavy for the delicate mechanics of a typewriter and will cause the gears and links to gum up and become stuck.

***Warning***: Never oil any rubber components: applying oil to the platen, feeder, or paper bail rollers will degrade the rubber over time and transfer to the ink ribbon and paper.

***Warning***: Avoid oiling the segment, vibrator mechanics, or line spacing mechanics. While these components move frequently and are metal-on-metal connections, they are most susceptible to attracting dust and debris given that they are fully exposed during use.

 1. Identify metal-on-metal connections, gears, and pivot points that seem to be hesitant in movement or completely stiff. Common areas that will need lubrication include the carriage rails, and internal pivot points, levers, and gears.
 2. Using a precision applicator, such as a small pipet or medicine dropper, apply one to two drops of oil where needed, immediately wiping away the excess with a rag or cotton swab.
    - Note: It is important not to excessively oil a typewriter, as even light weight lubricants will attract dust and debris over time, causing more harm than good in the long run. Only use minimal oil, wiping away any excess as you go.


## Clean The Exterior

Smith Corona Typewriter panels are typically made of non-porous material that will resist staining from dirt, ink, and other debris. Mild soap and water is typically an adequate cleaning solution, but other household cleaners and detergents may also be used. 

 1. Patch test cleaners on all panel surfaces by taking a cotton swab’s worth of your cleaner and rubbing it onto a small, inconspicuous section of each panel. 
    - ***Warning***: If bubbling, discoloration, or paint stripping occurs, remove the cleaner from the panel immediately and patch test a gentler cleaning solution.
    - Note: Do this for every panel, just in case the panels have been replaced, repainted, or refinished in the past, as they may react with certain chemicals.
 2. Apply cleaning solution to a lint free rag, and then apply to the typewriter panels in thin coats, using a circular rubbing motion to clean the surface. Repeat until you have reached your desired cleanliness.
    - ***Warning***: Avoid touching any decals, branding components, or model names on the typewriter as even mild soap and water can remove the paint.
    - Note: Do not spray cleaner directly onto the machine panels, as it can leave streaks on the machine where the solution concentration is highest.
 3. Apply cleaning solution to a cotton swab, and gently clean around any labels, decals, or model/branding names with extra caution to avoid removing the label paint.
 4. Apply cleaning solution to a new cotton swab, and gently clean typewriter keys and knobs, repeating with a fresh cotton swab as needed
    - Note: If key caps, knobs, or other high-touch surfaces have tar build up, indicated by severe yellowing of their surfaces, you may remove them and soak in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 4 to 8 hours.
 5. Dampen a lint-free cloth with clean water and wipe down the panels to remove any excess cleaner.
 6. Wipe down the panels with a dry cloth, and set them in direct sunlight, or in front of a fan, for a few hours to a couple of days to fully dry.
 7. Optional: If your Smith Corona Sterling has steel or aluminum panels, you can apply car wax, as directed on the wax container, to create a glossy finish and prevent rusting.

## Clean The Case

Like their typewriter panels, Smith Corona Holiday Cases are made of a non-porous material in order to resist staining, so most stains can easily be removed with mild soap and water. 

- If your machine came in a **different style of case**, follow the instructions below in accordance with the type of case you have. 
- If your machine **did not come with a portable case**, but rather a **dust cover**, follow the directions below while skipping the steps related to case frames and hinges (steps 1, 2, 6, and 7).
- If your machine **did not come with its portable case or a dust cover**, consider buying one of the two as it will prolong the life of your machine.

 1. Remove the fastening frame from the case by pressing the frame release lever to the right, while simultaneously lifting the bottom of the frame upwards and sliding the frame points out of their respective rear retainer slots.
 2. Remove the lid from the case by fully opening the case and pressing both the right and left hinge latches simultaneously and unhooking them.
    - Note: If your case is different from the Smith Corona Holiday Case, your hinges may need to be unscrewed for removal rather than being unhooked.
 3. Dampen a lint-free rag with a mixture of mild soap and water and gently rub the case components, including the frame, in circular motions to remove stains or stuck-on debris. Repeat as necessary to fully remove dirt, staining, and debris.
    - Note: If your case is different from the Smith Corona Holiday Case, you may need a different cleaning solution based on the case material. For leather, cloth, or carpet cases, research and patch test all detergents and cleaners before use.
 4. Use a cotton swab soaked in the cleaning solution to remove stuck on dirt and debris from the case hinges and frame levers and gears.
 5. Dry the surface of the case with a clean, lint-free cloth and set out in direct sunlight, or in front of a fan, for up to two to three days to fully dry and remove any odors.
 6. Replace the lid onto the case by lining up the two halves of both hinges, rehooking them, and pushing the hinge sections together with mild pressure until they snap into place.
 7. Replace the frame by sliding the frame points back into their respective rear retainer slots and snapping the front of the frame down into a latched position.

## Assemble The Typewriter

 1. Line up the metal segment plate with the typewriter feet. 
 2. Slide the two prongs on one side of the plate into the two slots on their respective typewriter foot. 
 3. Applying gentle pressure in the direction of the inserted prong-slot connection, firmly push down until the prongs on the other side of the plate line up with the slots in the remaining foot, removing pressure from the other side once the prongs are fully inserted into the foot slots.
 4. Line up the panel component screw slots with their corresponding slots on the typewriter frame.
 5. Insert and tighten the panel screws until all panel components are reattached.
 6. If any key caps or knobs were removed in the cleaning process, reattach them now.

## Place Typewriter Back Into Case

 1. Center the carriage of the typewriter.
 2. Pick up the typewriter and tilt the front end of the machine upwards approximately 2 to 3 inches. 
 3. Slowly insert the typewriter into the case, ensuring that the double-pronged cleat at the back of the case slides into the two slots on the back of the machine. 
 4. Push the front of the machine down so that it latches onto the front cleat.
 5. Check to ensure that the machine is secure by lifting the front end of the typewriter. If it is secure, it will not lift from the case.
 6. Optional: If the typewriter will be unused, or in storage, for extended periods of time, consider adding one or two moisture packets, such as silica gel packs, inside of the case to absorb excess moisture and prevent rusting.
