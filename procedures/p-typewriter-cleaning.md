## Prepare the Work Area

 1. Select a well-ventilated space, ideally with windows and access to direct sunlight.
 2. Lay out paper towels or plastic sheeting to fully cover your work surface.
 3. Put on nitrile gloves so that mineral spirits, cleaning agents, and waxes do not touch your skin.

## Remove Typewriter From Case

Portable Smith Corona machines will typically come in a popular case known as the “Holiday Case.” It is a bit larger than normal typewriter carriers, and has the ability of being disassembled.

 1. Place the typewriter case down on a level surface, with the thinner side of the case on the bottom.
 2. Press the double safety lock to open the case.
 3. Push the machine release button back, towards the carriage return, to release the machine from the case.
 4. Lift the front side of the machine upwards, 2 to 3 inches, and pull the typewriter towards yourself, away from the hinges of the case. 


## Remove Typewriter Panels

 1. Locate the body screws, typically found on the underside of the typewriter, along the edges of the body panels.
 2. Unscrew the body screws and set off to the side, making sure you keep track of which ones go where as they each have different lengths and threads.
 3. Gently lift the panels off of the typewriter, and set aside.
 4. Locate the metal plate on the underside of the typewriter, directly under the segment. This plate is not screwed in, but held in place by four metal prongs that slide into the feet of the typewriter. 
 5. Gently pry the plate outward using a wide, flat-head screwdriver, so the prongs slide out of the slots in one of the feet and the plate falls out.
