  <shortdesc>

  </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
   <ul>
      <li>The platen begins to lose its grip, causing uneven paper feeding.</li>
      <li>The typing impression weakens due to reduced friction between the paper and roller surface.</li>
      <li>Dirty or hardened platen rollers limit the typewriter’s performance and make the paper slip during typing.</li>
      <li>These conditions indicate that the platen may need cleaning, repair, or replacement.</li>
