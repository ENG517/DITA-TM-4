      <title>Key Considerations</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Surface protection</b> – The use of plastic coverings, paper towels, or absorbent cloth prevents ink from staining tables and surrounding surfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Organization of ribbons</b> – A designated space for both the new and used ribbons ensures clear separation and minimizes contamination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Clean handling area</b> – A tidy workspace supports accuracy in positioning and avoids interference from external objects or dust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ink management awareness</b> – Understanding that ribbons contain high ink saturation helps prevent unintended smudges and residue transfer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Preventive preparation</b> – Workspace setup functions as a precautionary measure that reflects attention to maintenance efficiency and cleanliness.
