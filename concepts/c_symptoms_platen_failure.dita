  <title>Symptoms of Platen Failure</title>
    <shortdesc>The condition of your platen roller contains indicators that may suggest a malfunction.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
      <p>There are a few common indicators that suggest a malfunction in the platen of a typewriter.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The platen begins to lose its grip, causing uneven paper feeding.</li>
          <li>The typing impression weakens due to reduced friction between the paper and roller surface.</li>
          <li>Dirty or hardened platen rollers limit the typewriter's performance and make the paper slip during typing.</li>
        </ul>
        <note type="note">These conditions indicate that the platen may need cleaning, repair, or replacement.</note>
