  <title>When to Change a Typewriter Ribbon</title>
  <shortdesc>
   The clarity and visibility of typed text indicate when a typewriter ribbon requires replacement.
  </shortdesc>
<conbody>
    <p>
      Over time, the ink on a typewriter ribbon fades as it transfers to paper through repeated use. 
      When this occurs, the typed characters begin to appear faint or semi-transparent, suggesting that the ribbon has lost sufficient ink saturation to produce crisp impressions.

      <title>Visual Indicators</title>
      <p>
        The most common sign that a ribbon requires replacement is the appearance of pale or see-through letters on the page. 
        These visual changes reflect the depletion of ink and reduced transfer efficiency during typing.
