    <p>
      After a new ribbon is installed, your text may continue to appear smudgy or unclear. 
      This may result from insufficient ribbon tautness or dirty type slugs.
      Recognizing these underlying conditions ensures that your ribbon functions effectively.

      <title>Ribbon Tension</title>
      <p>
        A newly installed ribbon may lack adequate tension. 
        When your ribbon is too loose, its surface does not meet the paper evenly during typing, leading to excessive ink transfer and smudging. 
        Proper ribbon tautness allows for consistent contact and cleaner ink impressions.

      <title>Residue on Type Slugs</title>
      <p>
        Ink residue or debris may accumulate on your type slugs during the ribbon installation process. 
        This buildup prevents even ink distribution and results in blurred or smudged characters. 
        Clean type slugs contribute to precise, well-defined text impressions.
